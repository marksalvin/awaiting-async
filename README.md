## About

awaiting-async is an async await precursor for promise based flow control sanity.

This library is designed to be lightweight (working only with promises) and well tested making it suitable for use in anger.

## Usage

First, run:

```
yarn install awaiting-async
```

or

```
npm install awaiting-async
```

Sample code shown below:

```
const aa = require('awaiting-async');

aa(function * () {
  const result = yield Promise.resolve('Hello world!');
  console.log(result); // Hello world!
});
```

Simple! Enjoy.

(Tested and working against Node.js v6.x.x, testing against more platforms to come...)
